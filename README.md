gim -- Git for Mortals
----------------------

Gim is a "porcelain" for Git.

There are many graphical clients and IDE plugins for Git available. Gim
tries to be the _command line_ experience you would enjoy working with as
a developer.

Gim provides only a subset of the options and features offered by Git.
The idea was to exchange flexibility for conciseness, a pleasant user
experience for those looking to “just check in my work” as opposed to
full-time repository maintainers Git itself is geared towards.

It was inspired by Elijah Newren's EasyGit, but is a wholly separate work.
